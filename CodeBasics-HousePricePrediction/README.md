This data science project takes a step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using the Banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. The second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests. The third component is the website built in HTML, CSS, and javascript. It allows the user to enter the home square ft area, bedrooms, etc., and it will call the python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During the model building, we will cover almost all data science concepts. It includes data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k-fold cross-validation, etc.
Technology and tools wise this project covers,

* Python
* Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
* Sklearn for model building
* Jupyter notebook, visual studio code as IDE
* Python flask for HTTP server
* HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
