# Project Overview

This project involves analyzing customer behavior in an e-commerce company using user session data collected over a year. The objective is to predict whether a user made a purchase or not during that period using other user attributes. It's important to note that the data was collected by non-experts, so certain columns may contain errors.

## Business Problem

The e-commerce company is interested in understanding customer behavior to improve their marketing strategies and increase sales. By analyzing user session data, they aim to predict which customers are more likely to make a purchase and identify the factors that contribute to this behavior.

## Data

The data consists of user session data collected over a year, with each row representing a unique user. The "Made_purchase" column indicates whether the user completed a purchase during the period. The dataset may contain errors due to non-expert data collection.

## Methods

The analysis will involve using various statistical and machine learning techniques to identify user attributes that are predictive of purchase behavior. Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection and evaluation will be carried out to achieve this 
objective.

## Evaluation Metric

The evaluation metric for this competition is the [Mean F1-Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score). The F1 score is a common accuracy metric used in information retrieval, which measures accuracy using the statistics precision. It weights recall and precision equally, which means that a good retrieval algorithm will maximize both precision and recall simultaneously. This approach favors moderately good performance on both metrics over extremely good performance on one and poor performance on the other.

## Results

The results of the analysis will provide insights into customer behavior when shopping, enabling the e-commerce company to improve their marketing strategies and increase sales.

## Conclusion

Analyzing user session data is an effective way of gaining insights into customer behavior and improving marketing strategies. By using statistical and machine learning techniques, we can predict which customers are more likely to make a purchase and identify the factors that contribute to this behavior.
